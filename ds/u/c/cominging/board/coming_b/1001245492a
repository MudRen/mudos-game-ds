                 Clumsiness and Mistake
  John Minor was a clumsy man and made a lot of mistakes.At night, he
went to bed, forgetting to brush his teeth.He got up to brush his teeth and
left the bathroom light on.He turned the light off and knocked over a
table in the dark. In the morning, he left home without his car keys. He
came back to get them and had a cup of coffee in the kitchen. Yet, he left
his house keys in the kitchen and he was late to work.
  At work, he forgot to click "save" on the computer and lost the most
important report his secretary had been typing. She yelled at him and
went to talk to John's boss.
  After work, when John got home, his wife was out shopping. He didn't
have his keys and couldn't get in. He tried to climb through a window.
the neighbors thought he was a thief and called the police. That night,
his wift got angry with him because he put fresh vegetables in the
freezer and meat in the vegetable drawer.
  Nobody liked John much. His wife didn't like him. His neighbors
didn't like him. His boss didn't like him and his secretary didn't like
him, either, becuase he was so clumsy and he made a lot of mistakes.

秉持一個觀念: 做別人的事, 學自己的功夫
              聽別人的課, 學自己的心得
忙茫盲？現代人的文明病，也許就像我一樣，••
        加油吧∼！
